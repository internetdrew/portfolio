## Why Company X

A short, sincere paragraph that shows you understand their world.
• What they’re trying to do
• Where you fit
• The opportunity you see
Keep this tight, maybe 3–4 lines max.

## What I Bring

A distilled list of capabilities that matter for them, not a generic resume.
Could be 3–5 items, each crisp:
• Creative strategy that translates brand values into visual language
• Brand filmmaking that feels cinematic yet grounded
• Technical ability to prototype AI-driven content experiences
• Content systems thinking (organization, workflows, scale)

## Relevant Work / Proof

A very small set of examples (2–3 max).
• One project that matches their style
• One that shows storytelling and craft
• One that shows technical or product thinking (if relevant)

Each with a one-sentence explainer. No walls of text.

## What I’d Do in My First 30 Days

This looks confident and shows you’re already thinking like part of their team.
Keep it super tight:
• Learn the brand at a deep level
• Identify storytelling moments or content opportunities
• Spot quick wins where you can immediately add value
• Map longer-term creative or product ideas

This makes you feel proactive but not arrogant.

## Personal Note

One small, human paragraph. Something like:
“I love working with creative founders and early teams. I care about cinematic storytelling, thoughtful tools, and brands with personality. If that’s you, I’d be excited to build with you.”
